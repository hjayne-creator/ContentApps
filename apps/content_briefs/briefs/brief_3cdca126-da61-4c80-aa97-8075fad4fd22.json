  "keyword_info": "NFC tag management refers to the process of overseeing and optimizing the use of Near Field Communication (NFC) tags, which are small devices that store and transmit data when in close proximity to NFC-enabled devices. Effective NFC tag management involves configuring, deploying, and maintaining these tags to ensure they deliver the intended information or service, such as contactless payments, access control, or marketing campaigns. It often includes tasks like programming the tags with specific data, tracking their usage and performance, and updating their content as needed. Proper management enhances user experience, operational efficiency, and the security of NFC applications.",
