  "keyword_info": "NFC (Near Field Communication) tags are small, wireless data storage devices that use radio frequency to communicate with NFC-enabled devices, such as smartphones. When in close proximity, typically within a few centimeters, these tags can trigger actions or exchange information without the need for power or a complex setup. Common applications include contactless payments, automated check-ins, and smart advertising. NFC tags are popular in marketing and retail for their convenience and ease of use, enabling seamless interactions between the physical and digital worlds, enhancing user experiences across various sectors.",
